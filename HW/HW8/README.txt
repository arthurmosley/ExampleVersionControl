TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

For testing and debugging I drew a bunch of diagrams and used a visualization tool on the internet that helped me understand the logic. Then I wrote the code and had segmentation faults. Simply ran GDB and backtraced until it was fixed and it worked. Started writing split and I conceptually understood it but implementing was a whole other story.
